["index.html", "XAI Stories Preface", " XAI Stories 2020-03-30 Preface Machine learning has a number of applications. Very often, however, machine learning predictive models are treated as black boxes which can be automatically trained without worrying about the domain in which they are used. The development of XAI tools allows to x-ray these black boxes. In the following chapters, we show example applications of different XAI techniques to real-world problems. TODO: write more about how the course This book is the result of a student projects for Interpretable Machine Learning course at the University of Warsaw and the Warsaw University of Technology. Each team has prepared one case study for selected XAI technique. This project is inspired by a fantastic book Limitations of Interpretable Machine Learning Methods created at the Department of Statistics, LMU Munich. We used the LIML project as the cornerstone for this repository. Cover by (???)
