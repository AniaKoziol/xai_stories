Very often, however, machine learning predictive models are treated as black boxes which can be automatically trained without worrying about the domain in which they are used. The development of XAI tools allows to x-ray these black boxes. In the following chapters we show example applications of different XAI techniques to real-world problems. TODO: more about how the course This book is the result of a student projects for Interpretable Machine Learning course at University of Warsaw and Warsaw University of Technology. Each team has prepares one case study for selected XAI technique. This project is inspired by a fantastic book Limitations of Interpretable Machine Learning Methods created at the Department of Statistics, LMU Munich. We used the LIML project as cornerstone for this reopsitory. Cover by (???)
